Specifically, it implements a transaction management sub-system that is atomic, durable and supports serializability (satisfying these properties is traditionally known as being ACID-compliant in database terminology). That is, every query, data manipulation command, every DDL (i.e., new node/rel table schema definitions), or COPY FROM commands to K\xf9zu is part of a transaction. Therefore they depict all-or-nothing behavior, so after these commands or a set of them execute and committed successfully, you are guaranteed that all of their changes will persist entirely. If they do not execute successfully or are rolled back, you are guaranteed that none of their changes will persist. These conditions hold, even if your system crashes at any point during a transaction. That is, after committing successfully, all your changes will persist even if there is an error after committing. Similarly, if your system crashes before committing or rolling back, then none of your updates will persist.","sidebar":"docSidebar"},"data-export/csv-export":{"id":"data-export/csv-export","title":"CSV","description":"COPY TO clause can export query result into a CSV file.","sidebar":"docSidebar"},"data-export/index":{"id":"data-export/index","title":"Data Export","description":"The COPY TO command allows you to export query results directly to a CSV file.","sidebar":"docSidebar"},"data-export/parquet-export":{"id":"data-export/parquet-export","title":"PARQUET","description":"COPY TO clause can export query results into a Parquet file.","sidebar":"docSidebar"},"data-import/csv-import":{"id":"data-import/csv-import","title":"CSV","description":"You can load the initial versions of your node and rel tables from CSV files","sidebar":"docSidebar"},"data-import/index":{"id":"data-import/index","title":"Data Import","description":"There are many ways to insert data into K\xf9zu.
