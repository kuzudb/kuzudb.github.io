Expressions can be very simple or arbitrarily complex. Variables that bind to node and relationship properties, aliases from previous parts of the query, literals (i.e., constants), are examples of most simples expressions. Using logical and arithmetic operators, and functions recursively, you can create arbitrarily complex expressions.","slug":"/category/functions-and-expressions","permalink":"/docusaurus/category/functions-and-expressions","navigation":{"previous":{"title":"Null Value","permalink":"/docusaurus/cypher/data-types/null"},"next":{"title":"Aggregate Functions","permalink":"/docusaurus/cypher/expressions/aggregate-functions"}}}')}}]);
